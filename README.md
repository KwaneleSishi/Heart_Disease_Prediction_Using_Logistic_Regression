The World Health Organization has estimated that four out of five cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks. This research aims to:

Identify the ratio of patients who possess a high chance of being affected by CVD.

Predict the overall risk of CVD using Logistic Regression.

What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine-learning technique used to classify records in a dataset based on the values of input fields. It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more sets of independent variables to estimate outcomes. Logistic Regression can be applied for:

Binary Classification (e.g., yes/no, 0/1 outcomes)

Multi-Class Classification (e.g., predicting categories)

Data Preparation

The dataset originates from an ongoing cardiovascular study conducted on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether a patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset includes:

Over 4,000 records

15 attributes detailing patient information such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.
